********
Overview
********

``NDlib`` is a Python language software package for the describing, simulate, and study diffusion processes on complex networks.

---------------
Who uses NDlib?
---------------

The potential audience for ``NDlib`` includes mathematicians, physicists, biologists, computer scientists, and social scientists. 

-----
Goals
-----

``NDlib`` is built upon the NetworkX_ python library and is intended to provide:

- tools for the study diffusion dynamics on social, biological, and infrastructure networks,
- a standard programming interface and diffusion models implementation that is suitable for many applications,
- a rapid development environment for collaborative, multidisciplinary, projects.

------------------------
The Python NDlib library
------------------------

``NDlib`` is a powerful Python package that allows simple and flexible simulations of networks diffusion processes.

Most importantly, ``NDlib``, as well as the Python programming language, is free, well-supported, and a joy to use.
