Independent Cascades with Community Permeability
**************************************************

The Independent Cascades with Community Permeability model was introduced by Milli and Rossetti in 2019 [#]_.

This model is a variation of the well-known Independent Cascade (IC), and it is designed to embed community awareness into the IC model.
This model exploits the idea of permeability. A community is “permeable” to a given content if it permits that content to spread from it fast
(or  vice-versa,  if  it  permits  the  content  to  be  easily  received  from  nodes  outside the  community).  Conversely,  a  community  has  a  low  degree  of  permeability  if  it dampens the diffusion probability across its border.

The ICP model starts with an initial set of **active** nodes A0; the diffusive process unfolds in discrete steps according to the following randomized rule:

- When node v becomes active in step t, it is given a single chance to activate each currently inactive neighbor u. If v and u belong to the same community, the method works as a standard IC model (it succeeds with a probability p(v,u)); instead, if the nodes are part of to different communities, the likelihood p(v,u) is dampened of a factor :math:`\eta` (the community permeability parameter).
- If u has multiple newly activated neighbors, their attempts are sequenced in an arbitrary order.
- If v succeeds, then u will become active in step t + 1; but whether or not v succeeds, it cannot make any further attempts to activate u in subsequent rounds.
- The process runs until no more activations are possible.

Statuses
--------

During the simulation a node can experience the following statuses:

===========  ====
Name         Code
===========  ====
Susceptible  0
Infected     1
Removed      2
===========  ====


----------
Parameters

======================  =====  ===============  =======  =========  ======================
Name                    Type   Value Type       Default  Mandatory  Description
======================  =====  ===============  =======  =========  ======================
Edge threshold          Edge   float in [0, 1]   0.1     False      Edge threshold
Community permeability  Model  float in [0, 1]   0.5     True       Community Permeability
======================  =====  ===============  =======  =========  ======================

The initial infection status can be defined via:

    - **fraction_infected**: Model Parameter, float in [0, 1]
    - **Infected**: Status Parameter, set of nodes

The two options are mutually exclusive and the latter takes precedence over the former.

Example
-------

In the code below is shown an example of instantiation and execution of an ICP model simulation on a random graph: we set the initial set of infected nodes as 1% of the overall population, assign a threshold of 0.1 to all the edges and set the community permeability equal 0.3.


.. code-block:: python

    import networkx as nx
    import ndlib.models.ModelConfig as mc
    import ndlib.models.epidemics as ep

    # Network topology
    g = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(1000, 0.1)

    # Model selection
    model = ep.ICPModel(g)

    # Model Configuration
    config = mc.Configuration()
    config.add_model_parameter('fraction_infected', 0.1)
    config.add_model_parameter('permeability', 0.3)


    # Setting the edge parameters
    threshold = 0.1
    for e in g.edges():
        config.add_edge_configuration("threshold", e, threshold)

    model.set_initial_status(config)

    # Simulation execution
    iterations = model.iteration_bunch(200)
